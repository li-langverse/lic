# Li

**理** — *reason, principle.*

Li is a language for people who want their programs to be **correct before they are fast**, and **clear before they are clever**.

You write ordinary-looking code. Before anything runs, Li checks that your promises about the program hold — like a careful reviewer who never gets tired. When that check passes, you get a real program that can use many CPU cores and vector math **without** bolting on extra libraries for parallelism or speed.

---

## Hello, Li

Save this as `hello.li`:

```nim
proc main() -> int
  requires true
  ensures result == 0
  decreases 0
=
  echo "Hello from Li"
  return 0
```

Build and run (after [installing the tools](docs/guide/getting-started-tools.md) once):

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./build/compiler/lic/lic build hello.li -o hello
./hello
```

Every Li program includes small **promises** (`requires`, `ensures`, `decreases`). They are not comments — they are what Li uses to know your program makes sense.

---

## A slightly bigger example

Counting with a loop:

```nim
proc main() -> int
  requires true
  ensures result == 0
  decreases 0
=
  var total: int = 0
  var n: int = 0
  while n < 1000
    total = total + n
    n = n + 1
  return 0
```

Li insists that loops say how they finish (`decreases`) so endless loops cannot slip through by accident.

---

## Fast math on many lanes (vectors)

Li can work on **several numbers at once** — useful for science and graphics-style workloads:

```nim
proc main() -> int
  requires true
  ensures result == 0
  decreases 0
=
  var x: float = 0.001
  var acc: float = 0.0
  var i: int = 0
  while i < 1000000
    var v: simd[f64, 4] = __li_simd_splat_f64(x)
    var p: simd[f64, 4] = __li_simd_mul_f64(v, v)
    acc = acc + __li_horiz_sum_f64(p)
    x = x + 0.000001
    i = i + 1
  return 0
```

You do **not** need NumPy, a special C extension, or a separate vector library for this — it is part of the language.

More examples: [Vector and parallel guide](docs/guide/fast-math-and-parallelism.md).

---

## Many cores, safely

Use all your CPU cores only when Li can see that threads will not fight over the same memory:

```nim
proc main() -> int
  requires true
  ensures result == 0
  decreases 0
=
  var buf: array[8, float]
  var i: int = 0
  while i < 8
    buf[i] = 1.0
    i = i + 1
  parallel for j in 0..<8
    requires disjoint_elem(j, buf)
    decreases 8 - j
  =
    buf[j] = 0.0
  return 0
```

If two threads would write the same slot, **the build stops** — you fix it before running, not after a mysterious crash.

## Three ideas that define Li

| Idea | In plain words |
|------|----------------|
| **Prove it** | Wrong programs are rejected at build time, not discovered in production. |
| **Write it easily** | Familiar, readable syntax — closer to Nim and Python than to assembly. |
| **Run it fast** | After proof, the same code becomes native speed with vectors and multiple cores. |

Proof always comes first. Speed never skips the check.
